**Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)**
Aaron did a good job in organizing his notebook and making it easy to follow. I really like his use of stacked bar charts to reflect the data.

**Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)**
I found the selection of feature to be interesting. Given that case 4 is a combination of stalk-color-below-ring and stalk-color-above-ring, I am curious on why he did not create a new feature for stalk color. I also would like more information on why he decided on the combination of habitat and cap-color. While I think both of them could be a good predictor, I was surprised that he used the combination of them without any cases for either of them by themselves. Overall, I think his chosen features do make sense given the objective.

**Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)**
I think that he explained the models clearly.  However, I was surprised to see that he only used case 1 in his decision tree model. While that case performed very well, it only represents the ability to analysis that one variable and may not be as accurate on the other cases.

**Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)**
I think that his insights are well thought out for what he did.  I do think that his conclusion about the decision tree model is a bit premature as he did not include results for more than 1 case.  The dataset performed fairly well overall for all of the models used, so I think it is hard to say that the decision tree model performs the best when only one case was tested on it.

I really enjoyed Aaron's presentation, and he included a lot of details that demonstrate and describe what he is intending to show with his analysis. I found his analysis had some humor in it, and he did a good job in ensuring that his audience would be engaged and informed.
