**Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)**
Brittany's notebook is well organized and easy to follow. I like the way she broke down her work and was clearly in demonstrating her analysis.

**Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)**
Looking at Brittany's charts, I think her feature selection does make sense for the objective of predicting mpg. I found it interesting that she used a combination of the features to do the analysis. I would have been interested in seeing how the individual features compared to the combined features.

**Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)**
Brittany's clearly explains her results.

**Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)**
Brittany does well with her reflections and in explaining her results. I thought her final thoughts were well laid-out and that she was insightful in her suggestion of using one-hot encoding or to attempt other models.
